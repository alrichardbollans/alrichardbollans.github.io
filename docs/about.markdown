Hi! My background is in the foundations of mathematics but I'm currently focussed on using machine
learning to tackle a variety of challenges within botany and mycology.

My main work looks at methods to search the estimated 343,000 known vascular plant species for new compounds of pharmaceutical interest, but I'm
also working on projects involving computer vision, text mining, metabolomics, nomenclature etc...

If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to get in touch.
