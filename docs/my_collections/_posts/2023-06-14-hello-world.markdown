# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first blog post built
with [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I hope you like it!

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
